About the code, you need to modify some lines, but only to write the
path to .lammpstrj file and to define each molecule type based on your
LAMMPS topology file info.

The code is full of relevant comments and instructions, the instructions
are essential and if you want to know what is happening in each line,
read the comments too.

Thanks for choose this bash/python code, hope you enjoy.
